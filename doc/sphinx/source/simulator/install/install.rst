Install
=======

This project uses ``Cmake`` in order to generate any type of projects (Makefile,
Visual Studio projects, Eclipse projects, etc.).

The first step is to install correctly the work environment with the right
programs. Then you will need to download and compile AFF3CT code. At this step
you may want to use several compilation options to configure correctly AFF3CT
with your engine and needs.
